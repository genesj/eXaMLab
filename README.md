<p>
  eXaMLab is a Python utility that lets you write quizzes for Moodle without ever having to open a web browser, follow any hyper-specific conventions, or press any keyboard button more unusual than the comma key.
</p>
<h2>What is Moodle XML?</h2>
<p>
  <b>MoodleXML</b> is a Moodle-specific format for writing questions to be used with the Quiz module.

  </ul>
</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Python 3.12.x and above is required to run the program. Download Python at <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">python.org</a> or from the Microsoft Store.<br>
The .exe file comes packaged with the relevant Python version, and averts the need to install anything.<br>
There are no external dependencies. All modules used are part of the Python standard library.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
Windows users are able to install the latest version from the Releases tab and launch examlab.exe. MacOS and Linux users, at this time, must run examlab.py manually.
</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Support for the most common question types:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Multiple Choice</li>
    <li>True/False</li>
    <li>Short Answer</li>
    <li>Essay</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Question list GUI grows as you build your quiz; plainly see and edit questions you made earlier in the test bank</li>
  <li>Imports directly into Moodle as its own question category (name defined by you)</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>
Images cannot be embedded into questions built with eXaMLab. To embed images, you must edit questions after importing your .XML file.
</p>

</p>
<ul>
<li>
Drag and Drop

</ul>
<h2>How do I use it?</h2>
<p>Every input field in eXaMLab has tooltips that appear when you hover over it - the readme is built-in to the program.</p>
