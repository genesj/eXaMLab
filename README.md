<p>
  eXaMLab is a Python utility that lets you write basic quizzes for Moodle without ever having to open a web browser, follow any hyper-specific conventions, or press any keyboard button more unusual than the comma key.
</p>
<h2>What is Moodle XML?</h2>
<p>
  <b>MoodleXML</b> is a Moodle-specific format for writing questions to be used with the Quiz module.
